# A-demo
A small part of the data analytics web app


The files in A-demo is an initial version of my first serious industry-ready project which I worked on.

To provide a bit of context, the code reads a set of rules defined in a csv file. It then parses through data generated from machines(conatined in csv files) and stores the details of the machine(s) which is/are breaking those rules.
